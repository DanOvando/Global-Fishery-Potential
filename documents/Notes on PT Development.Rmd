A few general notes on the transition to PT

* With the derivation Chris is using, we need $\phi$ to be 0.188, not 1.188, in order to get BMSY=0.4K
* $Bmsy/K= \frac{1}{(\phi+1)^{1/\phi}}$
* So, to go from B/Bmsy to B/K, take $\frac{B}{B_{msy}}(\frac{1}{(\phi+1)^{1/\phi}})$
* If steady state *f* is $\overline{f}=(\frac{\phi+1}{\phi})(1-\frac{\overline{b}^{\phi}}{\phi+1})$ then
